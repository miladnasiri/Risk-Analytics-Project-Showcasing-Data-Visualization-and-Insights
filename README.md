# Enterprise Risk Management Dashboard

![Risk Management Dashboard](https://github.com/miladnasiri/Risk-Analytics-Project-Showcasing-Data-Visualization-and-Insights/blob/ecf4bc9ec35aca92023e3960279cfd84864d9b8d/Risk%20Score%20Trends.png)

A comprehensive risk management analytics solution developed for  Risk Management team. This dashboard provides real-time risk analytics, visualization, and recommendations for enterprise risk management.



# Risk Management Dataset

This repository contains a synthetic dataset designed for testing and demonstration purposes in risk management analysis. The dataset simulates risk data across various departments, regions, and risk types, with additional attributes for each record, providing a comprehensive basis for analyzing risk trends, mitigation costs, control effectiveness, and other factors relevant to risk assessment.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is generated with the `DataLoader` class, which simulates risk data for different departments, regions, and risk types. Each record contains features like risk scores, incident counts, compliance scores, budget allocations, and other metrics that are commonly analyzed in risk management scenarios.

### Key Features

- **Dates**: Records cover 100 consecutive days starting from January 1, 2023.
- **Departments**: Four departments - IT, Finance, HR, and Operations.
- **Regions**: Four geographic regions - North, South, East, and West.
- **Risk Types**: Four types of risk - Operational, Financial, Compliance, and Strategic.

Each row in the dataset includes the following columns:

| Column               | Description                                                                                  |

| `budget_allocation`  | Budget allocated for risk management, between 100,000 and 1,000,000.                         |

| `previous_incidents` | Number of previous incidents, between 0 and 10.                                              |
| `recovery_time_hours`| Estimated recovery time in hours, drawn from an exponential distribution.                    |
| `control_effectiveness` | Effectiveness of risk controls, between 60 and 95.                                        |
